In addition to writing, Mathangi works on projects that bring art and storytelling to everyone. For her latest project, she worked with professional photographer [Greeshma Patel](http://www.greeshma.com) to put cameras in the hands of [anganwadi workers](http://http://www.globalpartnership.org/news/505/762/September-2013/), the women who run India's public day care system.
The result was an exhibition called Picturing Change. You can follow the project on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/PicturingChange) for updates on showings, media coverage, and information about anganwadis.
