Mathangi, Ed.D. writes about education, immigration, and feminism. She began her career as a public school teacher  and went on to work at Sesame Workshop (the nonprofit that produces Sesame Street and its co-productions around the world) and to serve as Senior Policy Analyst for former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. In 2012, she moved to Bangalore, India to pursue a Fulbright Fellowship. She never left.

Her work has appeared in scholarly journals and popular publications and blogs such as The Hindu, Al Jazeera America, and Gender and Education. She is the co-editor of [US Education in a World of Migration: Implications for Policy and Practice](/Books/Migration) and an Associate Editor at Anthropology and Education Quarterly. 

Although Mathangi writes for grown-ups, she prefers writing for kids. Her fiction for children has appeared in Kahani, Skipping Stones, and The Hindu Young World. Her first book for teens, [Bullying: The Ultimate Teen Guide](/Books/Migration), will be published by Rowman and Littlefield in April 2014.
